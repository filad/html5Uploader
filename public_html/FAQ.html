        <span class="description aligncenter">HTML5Uploader is a file upload script with resumable
            feature and MySQL backend support</span>

        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            This is a file upload script.<br>
            You can find it on Github:  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/filad/html5Uploader">https://github.com/filad/html5Uploader</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I needed a script which is resumable by default, easily customizable (you can make 'themes')
            and has a MySQL backend. <br>
            So I combined the powerful <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">jQuery-File-Upload plugin</a> with my own ideas.

        </p>
        <p>If you have any questions just write to: adam.filkor at gmail.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some basics about this uploader: <br>
            Only Javascript is used on the client side, no Flash or Java is required. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            All uploads are resumable (by default) which means you don't have to restart the whole uploading process after a connection loss, just drop the same files again and continue where you left.
            <br>
            To try it, drop a bigger file or files,
            then - during uploading - close your browser,
            your upload will continue when you drop the same files and start upload them again. <br>
            In case of older browsers, it will fallback to the old method
            (it will upload the files in one big chunk).
        </p>
        <p>
            The backend is using MySQL so you will have some work with the database. <br>
            See the following section.
        </p>

        <h3>How to install / integrate with my site?</h3>
        <p>
            Download it from GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/filad/html5Uploader">source</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a database. You will find the sample database structure in <i>db-structure.sql</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fill in your database credentials. Look at the <i>mysql-credentials-sample.php</i> for an example. The server is using <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php">PDO</a> for absraction. (MySQL is not the only option.)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want make a different 'theme' for the uploader, the easiest way would be to create a new .css file inside
            <i>public_html/assets/css/HTML5Uploader</i>. (You see there is already a <i>-defaultTheme.css-</i> stylesheet)
        </p>


        <h3>Important things I have to watch out for?</h3>
        <p>
            File uploading is only safe when your server is configured properly.
            When you are using Apache you must always ensure that .htaccess
            in the directories are working. Upload a sample php script file to see if it's
            interpreted by your server. <br>
            A better option is to move your <i>/files</i> folder outside from the public_html
            (for this you also have to rewrite the upload path inside the server).
        </p>

        <h3>What kind of options available?</h3>
        <p>
            Because this script is built upon the well known jQuery-File-Upload plugin you can use
            it's <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options">options</a>, but before you change anything you should know what you are doing,
            so always read about it first before you modify some options.<br>
            In HTML5Uploader the images are not processed at all.
            Neither in client nor server side. So you can't use the image
            related options unless you enable (rewite a script a bit) image processing in client/server side..
        </p>

        <h3>More details on 'resumable' uploads?</h3>
        <p>
            Well, by default the script will slice up the files and these small
            chunks will be sent to the server one by one. Let's call this 'chunking'.
            These parts will be merged on the server side.
        </p>
            <p>What are the advantages of this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you slice up the files there will be no memory limits.
                        You can even upload GB-s of data theoretically.
                        It's useful when you need to upload bigger files to a shared server
                        (where you can't touch php.ini).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another useful aspect of chunking is it's resumable,
                        which means if you have a power outage during the file upload,
                        or just close the browser / tab, it will simply continue the uploading process
                        from the latest chunk when you drop the same file(s).
                    </li>
                </ul>
        <p>
            How is this achieved?<br>
            In short: with the Javascript Blob object. This object has a slice() method. For further reference about the API see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob">MDN article</a> or the official <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/#dfn-Blob">w3</a> description about this topic.
